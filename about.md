Hi there! I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys solving problems and figuring out how to create things that make life easier. Growing up in Macedonia, a small country in Eastern Europe, gave me a unique mix of cultures and perspectives that shape how I approach challenges. I love figuring out how things work, whether it’s tech-related or not.
